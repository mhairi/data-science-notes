## Functions

In the code above we used two functions from R: `table` and `barplot`. A function is anything that takes an input and returns an output. 

The `table` function took our vector of data as an input and transformed it into an table.

The `barplot` function took in a table and transformed it into plot. 

We'll be using a lot of functions, and later we'll even be writing our own functions. They will all follow the same basic pattern of taking in an input and returning an output. We also always write them like this, with the input going in brackets after the name of the function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
some_function(some_input)
```

The output is normally a new R object, like the table we created above and assigned to `spinach_table`. But we can also have other types of output - like the plot we saw.
